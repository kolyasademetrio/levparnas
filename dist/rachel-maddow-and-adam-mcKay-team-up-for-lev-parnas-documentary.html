                  MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and filmmaker Adam McKay are joining
                  forces to produce a documentary about Lev Parnas, the
                  Ukrainian-born operative who played a key role in Donald
                  Trump's first impeachment.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  The documentary, titled "From Russia With Lev," will feature
                  exclusive interviews with Parnas, as well as access to his
                  personal archive of photos, videos, documents, and secret
                  recordings. Maddow and McKay will serve as executive producers
                  on the project, which is being directed by Billy Corben and
                  produced by Alfred Spellman.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Parnas' story is a wild one, involving his association with
                  Trump and Rudy Giuliani, as well as his role in a stealth
                  campaign to produce dirt on Joe Biden during the 2020
                  presidential election. Maddow has already interviewed Parnas
                  once before, on the eve of Trump's impeachment trial in
                  January 2020, which drew a huge audience for her MSNBC show.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Maddow describes Parnas as "a survivor of the most absolutely
                  unbelievable story" and says he's "kind of adorable" despite
                  being involved in one of the most scandalous political stories
                  in American history. The documentary promises to be a wild
                  ride, with Maddow and McKay bringing their signature styles to
                  the project.

                  This is not the first time Rakontur has partnered with
                  Hyperobject Industries - they previously worked together on
                  the Jerry Falwell Jr. story "God Forbid: The Sex Scandal That
                  Brought Down A Dynasty," which became Hulu's most viewed
                  feature documentary ever. With Maddow and McKay on board,
                  "From Russia With Lev" is sure to be a must-see.
