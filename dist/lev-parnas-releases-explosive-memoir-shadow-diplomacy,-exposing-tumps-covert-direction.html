                  In a highly anticipated Black Friday book launch, Lev Parnas,
                  a reformed former Trump insider, has released his biographical
                  memoir, Shadow Diplomacy: Lev Parnas and his Wild Ride from
                  the Streets of Brooklyn to Trump's Inner Circle. The book
                  offers readers an unprecedented insider's perspective into the

                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Shadow Diplomacy delves into Parnas' firsthand experiences,
                  shedding light on the secret maneuvers and clandestine
                  negotiations that shaped the global geopolitical landscape
                  during his years of international travel to Ukraine, Turkey,
                  Spain, Israel, Austria, France, the UK, and Poland. As a key
                  figure with unique access to corridors of power who acted as a
                  shadow presidential envoy, Parnas provides readers with a
                  compelling narrative.

                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  The book's timeline spans his involvement in critical
                  diplomatic efforts, including his conversation with Venezuelan
                  President Nicolas Maduro alongside Rudy Giuliani, to his solo
                  discussions with two Ukrainian presidents, and his former
                  political allegiance with an obscure Florida congressman who
                  later became the state's controversial governor due to their
                  friendship.

                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  With an unlikely path into politics that led him to intersect
                  with pivotal historical moments, Parnas offers an unfiltered
                  account of the shadowy undercurrents that influence
                  international relations. The memoir reveals untold stories,
                  shedding light on the intricate dance between political
                  figures, governments, and behind-the-scenes operators,
                  including the story behind the facts that led to ex-President
                  Donald Trump's first impeachment trial.

                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Shadow Diplomacy is set to impact political news as the House
                  Republican caucus continues an impeachment inquiry into
                  President Joe Biden over his son, Hunter Biden, which Parnas'
                  book proves is unfounded. In a statement, Lev Parnas remarked,
                  "I'm thrilled to share my experiences with readers in Shadow
                  Diplomacy. Never did I expect to land in the middle of our
                  country's international affairs alongside America's mayor and
                  a wealthy, powerful New York real estate developer who became
                  President of the United States."
