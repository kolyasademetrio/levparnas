                Lev Parnas Testifies Against Trump Allies in Impeachment Inquiry

                  In a dramatic turn of events, Lev Parnas, a former associate
                  of Rudy Giuliani, testified before the House Oversight
                  Committee on Wednesday, slamming Donald Trump and his allies
                  for spreading false allegations against the Biden family.
                  Parnas claimed that the impeachment inquiry is "pushing the
                  same Russian narrative and propaganda."
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Parnas, who worked with Giuliani in 2018 and 2019 to find
                  damaging information about President Joe Biden, stated that
                  there was no evidence of Biden family corruption involving
                  Ukraine and that the baseless accusations against the
                  president came from the Russian government.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  "The only information ever pushed on the Bidens and Ukraine
                  has come from one source and one source only: Russia and
                  Russian agents," Parnas said. He also claimed that Giuliani
                  understood the origins of the information they were receiving
                  and continued to work with those individuals despite knowing
                  it was false.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Parnas' testimony was met with skepticism by Trump allies,
                  with a representative for Giuliani calling him "desperate" and
                  "not to be trusted." However, Parnas maintained that he has
                  tried to convey information to federal prosecutors since late
                  2019 but was ignored by the Justice Department.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  The hearing was marked by tense exchanges between committee
                  members, with Democrats accusing Republicans of pushing a
                  false narrative and Republicans accusing Democrats of trying
                  to discredit Trump. The White House blasted the hearing as a
                  "sad charade" and called for an end to the investigation.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Parnas' testimony has significant implications for the
                  impeachment inquiry, which is expected to continue in the
                  coming weeks. His claims that Trump allies knowingly spread
                  false information about the Bidens could potentially damage
                  Trump's reputation and impact his chances of re-election in
                  2024.
