                  In a shocking turn of events, Lev Parnas, a key figure in
                  Donald Trump's Ukraine scandal, has come forward with a
                  damning testimony that sheds light on the administration's
                  efforts to cover up their wrongdoing. Parnas, who was tasked
                  by Rudy Giuliani to find dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter,
                  reveals that he traveled the globe to gather information, but
                  found nothing incriminating.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Parnas' testimony is a scathing indictment of Trump's
                  administration, alleging that they knowingly spread false
                  information about the Bidens to damage their reputations and
                  secure the 2020 election for Trump. He claims that Giuliani
                  approached him in November 2018 to ask about his contacts in
                  Ukraine and tasked him with finding disgraced prosecutor
                  Viktor Shokin.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  The testimony also reveals that Parnas was part of a shadow
                  diplomacy effort, known as the "BLT Team," which included John
                  Solomon, an investigative reporter for The Hill, and
                  then-Congressman Devin Nunes. He claims that they pushed false
                  narratives about the Bidens, despite knowing they were
                  baseless.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Parnas' account is corroborated by his interactions with
                  Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
                  whom he delivered a quid pro quo message from Giuliani:
                  investigate Joe Biden or face cuts in US aid. Parnas claims
                  that Zelenskyy refused to yield to the pressure.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  The testimony also highlights the involvement of other key
                  figures, including Senator Ron Johnson and media personnel,
                  particularly at FOX News, who used the false narrative to
                  manipulate the public ahead of the 2020 election. They are
                  still doing this today, as we approach the 2024 election.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Parnas' testimony is a significant blow to Trump's defense, as
                  it corroborates previous accounts of the Ukraine scandal and
                  highlights the administration's efforts to cover up their
                  wrongdoing. The testimony also underscores the need for
                  accountability and transparency in government, as Parnas notes
                  that "it is time to stand up and recognize the truth at this
                  pivotal moment – for Ukraine, for our country, and for our
                  future."
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  In a striking revelation, Parnas reveals that he was the
                  messenger that Trump and Giuliani sent to Ukraine to deliver
                  handshake arrangements in 2019. First to Ukraine's
                  then-president Poroshenko, where the message was that Trump
                  would support Poroshenko in his election if he agreed to
                  investigate the Bidens. Then with Prosecutor General Lutsenko,
                  who agreed to help us dig up information on the Bidens in
                  exchange for a meeting with then-U.S. Attorney General Bill
                  Barr.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Parnas' testimony also sheds light on the impact of this
                  conspiracy on the Russia-Ukraine war, as Trump has no
                  intention to keep aiding Ukraine. He told him in 2018, and he
                  is telling all of us now, that without the support of the
                  United States and NATO, Ukraine will not be able to withstand
                  the barrage from the Russian Army. Millions of people will
                  suffer and die.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  The testimony serves as a stark warning about the dangers of
                  allowing Russia to defeat Ukraine, as it will eventually lead
                  to suffering on American shores. If we do not support Ukraine
                  now, we will see an America where we need to have troops on
                  the ground defending our country, in cities and towns where
                  everyone's lives as they know it will have been destroyed.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  In a chilling conclusion, Parnas notes that every person
                  integral to this shadow diplomacy knew that the Biden
                  corruption rumors were baseless. Then-Congressman Devin Nunes,
                  Senator Ron Johnson, and many other individuals understood
                  that they were pushing a false narrative. The same goes for
                  John Solomon, Sean Hannity, and media personnel, particularly
                  at FOX News, who used that narrative to manipulate the public
                  ahead of the 2020 election. They are still doing this today,
                  as we approach the 2024 election.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Parnas' testimony is a call to action, urging us to stand up
                  and recognize the truth at this pivotal moment – for Ukraine,
                  for our country, and for our future. It is time to hold those
                  responsible accountable and ensure that such deceit and
                  corruption never happen again.
