                  Rachel Maddow's production banner, Surprise Inside, is set to
                  debut its first feature documentary "From Russia With Lev" at
                  the "MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024" conference on September 7 in
                  Brooklyn. The film chronicles the twisty tale of
                  Ukrainian-born operative Lev Parnas, whose association with
                  former President Donald Trump and attorney Rudolph Giuliani
                  took him on a strange journey that ended in a stealth campaign
                  to dig up dirt on then-candidate Joe Biden.

                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Directed by Billy Corben, "From Russia With Lev" draws on more
                  than 30 hours of new interview footage with Parnas and his
                  close network, as well as a never-before-seen personal archive
                  of photos, videos, documents, and secret recordings. Maddow
                  signed on to executive produce the film in January, four years
                  after she interviewed a remorseful Parnas on the eve of the
                  impeachment proceedings in January 2020.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  Maddow believes that "From Russia With Lev" will appeal to a
                  wide audience, describing it as an "insane, very gonzo story"
                  about a guy who's very interesting and funny. The film is not
                  just about politics, but also about how things actually work
                  inside the government when it is taken over by crooks.
                </p>
                <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
                  The documentary will have a limited release in arthouse
                  theaters and broadcast on MSNBC in late September. Maddow's
                  Surprise Inside venture aims to tackle a wide range of
                  documentary fare beyond stories with political themes, with
                  the goal of entertaining while holding all films to
                  journalistic standards.
