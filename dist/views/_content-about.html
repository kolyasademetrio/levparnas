            <p class="about__itemSubtitle">Early Life and Career</p>
            <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
              Parnas was born on February 6, 1972, in Odessa, Ukraine. He
              immigrated to the United States with his family at a young age and

            <p class="about__itemSubtitle">Trump-Ukraine Scandal</p>
            <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
              Parnas was a key figure in the Trump-Ukraine scandal, which led to
              the impeachment of President Donald Trump. He worked closely with
              Rudy Giuliani to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who
              had business dealings in Ukraine. Parnas has admitted to being
              part of a shadow diplomacy effort to pressure Ukrainian officials
              to investigate the Bidens.
            </p>
            <p class="about__itemSubtitle">
              In his book "Shadow Diplomacy," Parnas details his involvement in
              the scandal and his interactions with Giuliani, Trump, and other
              key figures. The book provides a firsthand account of the events
              leading up to the impeachment inquiry and sheds light on the inner
              workings of the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine.
